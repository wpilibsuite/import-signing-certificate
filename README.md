# Import Signing Certificate

This Action imports an iOS or macOS signing certificate into a keychain. By default it creates a new temporary keychain that allows the Xcode tools to access the certificates.

> This Action has mostly been tested on macOS products. Although it probably just works, the goal is to support iOS and watchOS officially with the next release of this Action.

## Basic Usage

For simple projects where there is one scheme, invoking `xcode-archive` can be as simple as this:

```yaml
- name: "Import Certificate: Development"
  uses: devbotsxyz/xcode-import-certificate@master
  with:
    certificate-data: ${{ secrets.DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_DATA }}
    certificate-passphrase: ${{ secrets.DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE }}
    keychain-password: ${{ secrets.KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD }
```

The certificate data should be a Base64 encoded `.p12` file, which is the default certificate export format of _Keychain Access.app_. The `keychain-password` input should be a (hard to guess) random password to be used for the temporary keychain.

## Full Example

The [devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings) project is an example macOS project with a [release.yml](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow that shows all the steps needed to go from creating a release in GitHub to ending up with a `.zip` file that contains a signed and notarized application.
